title: About

My name is Katie, and I am interested in the many ways we can look at information to 
discover the most interesting things about the world around us. I’m also interested in 
the methods we can use to communicate that information to others.

This is why I’ve started a blog chronicling my exploration of various data science and 
visualization methods. I recently began learning d3.js for visualization purposes and 
scikit-learn for machine learning, so I plan to start by chronicling some of the 
exercises I’ve been working on over the past several weeks. I hope that soon my posts 
will catch up to the projects I’m working on currently.

I currently work at the [Psychiatry Neuroimaging Lab](http://pnl.bwh.harvard.edu/) at 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital. There, I get to work with diffusion tensor tractography and volumetric data to confront
 questions about conditions such as traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. 
 I graduated from Brown University in 2012. While there, I learned for the first time 
 about some of the machine learning methods I hope to address in this blog in courses 
 like Computational Cognitive Science. Since then, I’ve learned Python through groups 
 such as [PyLadies](http://boston.pyladies.com/) and the [Boston Python User Group](http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/), 
 as well as MOOCs such as [Coding the Matrix – Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications](https://www.coursera.org/course/matrix). 

My interest in data science has continued to grow since then, and I hope that through 
this experience I can both improve my own skills and contribute to the learning process
 of others.

Thank you for visiting my blog! Feel free to email me at katiefg@gmail.com if 
you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello.
