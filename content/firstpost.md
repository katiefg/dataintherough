Hello, everyone, and welcome.

In my recent exploration of data science and visualization tools and attempts to apply them, I have found that there is rarely one resource that explains 100% of what needs to be done – and I’m glad, because the search for the information across multiple sources is half the fun! I hope that I can add to the pool of resources and examples available on the internet in a productive way, and that perhaps something I do on here will be the missing piece in someone else’s puzzle.

I recently received some valuable advice, stating that a good way to begin with a blog is to write as though your audience were yourself, two or three weeks ago. This way, you have a better grasp of the issues that are relevant when learning a new tool. Following that advice is how I plan to start this blog. 

Over the next several posts I’m going to be heavily referencing some really great resources I’ve found, so it seems this is as good a place as any to introduce them.

* [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web: An Introduction to Designing with D3](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345), by Scott Murray
This is the book I used to familiarize myself with D3. It has excellent code examples and is very user-friendly. Since this is where a lot of my D3 knowledge comes from, I’ll be coming back to it in future posts.

* [Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do), by Toby Segaran
 I will be working through some of the algorithms described in this book on this blog, and looking a bit more at their implementation.

* This link is on the links page too: I’ll be making extensive use of Mike Bostock’s [D3 Gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) for examples and inspiration. More specific references from within the gallery to follow!

Thank you again for stopping by and please feel free to contact me. I hope you enjoy your time here.


All the best,

Katie
