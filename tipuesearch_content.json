{"pages":[{"text":"Having already introduced myself on the home page, I'll keep this intro post brief. I went to a presentation through the Big Data Analytics, Discovery & Visualization meetup in Boston, in which Sam Selikoff (see sidebar) gave a wonderful presentation introducing D3. He mentioned that a good way to begin with a blog is to write with your audience as yourself, two or three weeks ago. This way, you have a better grasp of the issues that are relevant when learning a new tool. Following that advice is how I plan to start this blog, and I'll let it evolve from there. I'm going to be heavily referencing some really great resources I've found over the next several weeks, so I figure this is as good a place as any to introduce them. #) `http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345`_ __Interactive skjhdfklds, by Scott Murray This is the book I used to familiarize myself with D3. It has excellent code examples and is very user-friendly. Since this is where a lot of my D3 knowledge comes from, I'll be coming back to it in future posts. #) Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications, by Toby Segaran http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do I will be working through some of the algorithms described in this book on this blog, and looking a bit more at their implementation. #)This link is on the sidebar too, but it bears mentioning that I'll be making extensive use of Mike Bostock's D3 Gallery for examples and inspiration. More specific references from within the gallery to follow! Thank you again for stopping by and please feel free to contact me. I hope you enjoy your time here.
